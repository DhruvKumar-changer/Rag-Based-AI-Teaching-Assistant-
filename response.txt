In this course, we've covered web development topics extensively, but Core Web Vitals are a bit of a special case.

Core Web Vitals is actually not part of the standard curriculum for our Sigma web development course. I think there might be some confusion - in your course, we were supposed to cover SEO and Core Web Vitals specifically in HTML, and that's where this topic comes up.

To answer your question directly, "where is web vitals in this course", you can find the content related to Core Web Vitals in video number 6 of our Sigma web development series. In that video, at start time 0 seconds, we introduce Core Web Vitals and their importance. There's also a relevant section later on where we explain how these three core web vitals work and get their value.

I can guide you to the exact part of video number 6 by saying, head over to video number 6, and start watching from timestamp 0 seconds for an overview of Core Web Vitals. Then move forward to around 5 seconds into that same video for more details on why these vitals are important. Finally, jump straight to the timestamps where we dive deeper (around 234-237 seconds) on how exactly these three core web vitals work.
